# Real time map generation using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project proposes two methods of dynamically generating roads maps.

The first approach is based on Lindenmayer Systems and can be found into the "Disertatie - LSystem.ipynb" file. 
NOTE: requires access to the dataset in order to run.

The second approach is based on Deep Reinforcement Learning using tensorflow-agents framework and can be found into the "Disertatie - RL v2.ipynb" file.
